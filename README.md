## About Me

I'm currently a student in Software Engineering at UniBO, passionate about exploring new frameworks for Node.js such as Next.js and Nest.js. Recently, I developed a project for a restaurant menu that syncs seamlessly with POS systems, reflecting my interest in creating real-world, impactful solutions.

Outside of coding, I enjoy specialty coffees, biking, spending time in nature, cooking, and discovering good wines.
