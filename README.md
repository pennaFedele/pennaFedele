## About Me

👨‍💻 Hey there! I’m Fedele, a 💻 Software Engineering student at the University of Bologna 🇮🇹 with a strong passion for building modern, impactful web applications. I love experimenting with powerful frameworks like Next.js ⚡ and Nest.js 🚀 in the Node.js ecosystem.

🍝 One of my latest projects is a digital restaurant menu 📱 that syncs automatically 🔄 with POS systems.

☕ When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me sipping a specialty coffee ☕, biking around the city 🚴, enjoying the outdoors 🌇, cooking something tasty 👨‍🍳, or exploring new wines 🍷.
